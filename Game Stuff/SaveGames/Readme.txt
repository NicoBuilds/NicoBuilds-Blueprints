Hi!

This savegame has exceeded the UObject limit. In order to use it you will need to increase it! Please, remember to restore it afterwards. Even though nothing ever happened to my save, and I don't know of anyone who had issues, Coffee Stain tells that this might corrupt your world. 

I used to store over here all of my savegames, since I started the game to show the progression.
I decided to keep only the last one, to make the repo lighter.
Nevertheless I still have a local copy of the old savegames. If for any reason you want to check them out, just let me know! Leave me a comment on a youtube video or reddit post, and I post them!
