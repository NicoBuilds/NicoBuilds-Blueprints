Hi!

I used to store over here all of my savegames, since I started the game to show the progression.
I decided to keep only the last one, to make the repo lighter.
Nevertheless I still have a local copy of the old savegames. If for any reason you want to check them out, just let me know! Leave me a comment on a youtube video or reddit post, and I post them!
